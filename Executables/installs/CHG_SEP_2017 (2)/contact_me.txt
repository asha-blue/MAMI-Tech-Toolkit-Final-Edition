For reasons best known to itself (presumably to stop 'off ebay' sales) 
Ebay has now outlawed ALL external links in sellers listings with 
threats to suspend the listings/close the accounts of sellers who 
fail to comply 

Unfortunately that includes links to product drivers, product data sheets, 
manufacturers pdf files etc. 

As questions/answers may well involve mention of links to external files its 
no longer possible to have those conversations through ebays send seller a 
message facility

Instead I can be reached at either of the following email addresses if you 
have any questions regarding driver installation 

steviehtc@gmail.com

scooterboy101@btopenworld.com


Apologies for any inconvenience
