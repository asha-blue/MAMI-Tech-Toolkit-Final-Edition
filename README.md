Online resources to support the creation of your own MAMI Tech Toolkit!

The MAMI Tech Toolkit is a suite of 4 hardware tools and accompanying software application.

The toolkit was created as part of a research project within an engineering doctorate undertaken by me (Asha Ward) 
and thorugh the Centre for Digital Entertainment (https://www.digital-entertainment.org/) situated within the 
Bournemouth University, with funding for  the  CDE  granted  by  the  EPSRC  (code: EP/L016540/1). 

The aim was to facilitate access to active music-making. 

The project was undertaken in collaboration with Luke Woodbury, whose MAMI repository is situated here:Â 

https://github.com/lwoodbury/MAMI. 

This repository is an extension of that repository in that each of the hardware tools within the MAMI Tech Toolkit
has an 'app' created specifically for it, in order to make music and play with sound.

The resources provided in this repo were used to create the finalised kit and are provided in order 
to open source the project up to others!

What is in the repo?

This repo contains:

* Arduino libraries that are used within the kit that aren't part of the vanilla Arduino IDE download and 
  are third-party
  
* Build Stuff that contains components that were used to build the final application from the Max/MSP patchers.
  These are split into Mac and Windows folders and contain VST, third-party Max/MSP externals, and media that
  that is used in the patchers  
  
* Executables for both Mac and Windows as well as installs of drivers for the Arduino Clone boards used and to
  enable the third-party Mira app (https://cycling74.com/products/mira) to be used with the Windows application
  
* MAMITechToolkit documentation folder with a manual and intro to the kit which details information about the 
  hardware and how to use the software. Welcome to the Toolkit.pdf contains pictures of the MAMI Tech Toolkit 
  hardware
  
* Max/MSP folder containing the Max projects in both Mac and Windows format (due to syntaxical 
  discrepencies between the two conserning file naming/file path fetching etc)
  
* A folder for each tool then contains the arduino code and Fritzing diagram of that tool

Have fun and hit me up if you need a hand with any of it! :)
