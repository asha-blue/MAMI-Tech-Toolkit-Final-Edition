Online resources to support the creation of your own MAMI Tech Toolkit!

The MAMI Tech Toolkit is a suite of 4 hardware tools and accompanying software application.

The toolkit was created as part of a research project within an engineering doctorate undertaken by Asha Ward 
and thorugh the Centre for Digital Entertainment (https://www.digital-entertainment.org/) situated within the 
Bournemouth University. The aim was to facilitate access to active music-making.

The project was undertaken in collaboration with Luke Woodbury, whose MAMI repository is situated here: 

https://github.com/lwoodbury/MAMI. 

This repository is an extension of that repository in that each of the hardware tools have an 'app' created 
specifically to be able to use the tools in order to make music and play with sound.

The underlying Max/MSP patches and Arduino code that were used to create the above finalised kit are provided 
here in order to open source the project up to others!

What is in the repo?

This repo contains:
• MAMITechToolkit documentation folder with a manual and intro to the kit which details information about the 
hardware and how to use the software.
• MAMITechToolkit software folder with Arduino libraries that were used, build stuff (the components required 
when building the application within Max/MSP), executables, and Max/MSP. The executable folder contains installs 
for drivers for the arduino boards used (CHG_SEP_2017) and also Bonjour install executable (in order to make the 
Mira software used to allow for iPad wireless control with Max/MSP) to work on Windows operating systems. See 
more about that project here https://cycling74.com/products/mira. Also here are the Mac and Windows executables
• • • • •

A folder is provided with the software - both the final applications (for Mac and Windows operating systems) as 
well as the Max/MSP gubbins used to create the final applications also split into Mac and Windows (due to slight 
differences between naming mechanisms etc between the two). A folder of the Arduino libraries used is also provided. 
Build stuff features components that were needed when the application was built within Max/MSP • Each tool in the 
kit has its own folder featuring the Arduino code and a fritzing diagrams of that tool.
