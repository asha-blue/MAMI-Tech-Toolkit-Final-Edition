        <P>&quot;Sinnah the sinner, is its sin to be free, or is its sin to sound so lush?&quot;<BR></P>

        <P>Sinnah is a synth based on a single complex oscillator that includes five waveshapes with increasing spectral
        complexity, harmonics level for all waveshapes, noise level, and a delay matrix.</P>

        <P>The delay matrix can have various configurations, from a &quot;triple chorus&quot; per voice to highly randomized
        resonators, or tuned relatively to the note played.<BR>
        The delay matrix can also do multiple slapback echoes.<BR>
        The feedback control of the matrix can go from zero to extremely saturated and it&#39;s modulated by its own envelope.<BR>
        The output of each voice is stereo via the delay matrix, which features a stereo spread knob.<BR>
        The main analogue modelled ADSR envelope is loopable: two, three or continuous repeats.</P>

        <P>The envelope can modulate the waveshape selection and the harmonics level.</P>

        <P>The synth also features a subtractive stereo filter to carve the spectrum of the sound, somewhat like an equalizer, with
        three filters: high pass, low pass and band reject (notch).<BR>
        The band reject filter also features gain and bandwidth controls.</P>

        <P>Moreover a useful simple reverb is included.</P>

        <P>The oscillator is antialiased and can play eight voices or mono, and features octave and fine pitch controls.</P>

        <P>The GUI is fully drawn by vectors and resizeable, featuring an oscilloscope and peak meters. And eight colour schemes
        are available to fit your mood and taste.<BR>
        An extended ToolTip display provides information for each control at mouseover.<BR>
        So you don&#39;t need to read a lengthy manual to learn what a knob or a slider is for.</P>

        <P>The preset system is crossplatform, the files use the YAML format so they are very easy to read and edit if needed.
        Moreover, the preset names can support the complete international character set.</P>

        <P>Sinnah is a VA synth plugin, but instead of the standard subtractive resonant filter it uses a resonant delay
        network.</P>

        <P>Hard to describe its sound by words, despite the few controls the array of possible sounds is wide and wild<BR></P>

        <P><A name="delay" id="delay"></A><B>About the delay matrix.</B></P>

        <P>The delay matrix is made of three delay lines (comb filters if you like) feeding into each-other, each delay line is
        modulated by a LFO, the shape of the LFO is a kind of smoothed sample&amp;hold, pseudo random. A key point is that there is one
        delay matrix per note (or voice), so if you play for instance a 3 notes chord you&#39;ll be playing nine delay lines
        modulated with nine LFOs. Since the max voices is set at eight so far, for eight notes playing at the same time, with the
        delay matrix active and modulated, you have 24 delay lines and 24 LFOs running.</P>

        <P>Next thing to learn is that the delay lines can be tuned relatively to the frequency of the played note. That happens
        when the |memory| switch is off. You can tune each delay (comb filter) from zero to -24 semitones. At zero the delay line
        will have the same length of of cycle of the wave from the oscillator, hence resonating at the same frequency. The amount
        of resonance is given by the feedback level and its envelope. With &quot;lag&quot; at -12 the delay line will resonate one
        octave lower, and so on. So you see that with three delay lines per note and 24 semitones range for each delay you can
        create a great number of possible spectral variations, but the delay lines as said above also feed into each-other, so when
        you use more than one delay line you actually multiply the resonances.</P>

        <P>Note that the feedback signal in the delay matrix is saturated by a waveshaper therefore the higher the feedback level
        the more harmonics it will generate, getting into distortion. The phase switch inverts the feedback signal creating more
        dispersion and reducing the modulations from the LFOs.</P>

        <P>When the |memory| switch is on then the &quot;lag&quot; knobs display their values in milliseconds, now the delays line
        are no longer tuned to the oscillator frequencies and you can use the delays for echoes (up to 250 ms) or fixed resonances
        (when few ms are used).</P>

        <P>Depth (from zero to 10 ms) and Speed (from zero to 12 Hz) knobs adjust the modulation for each delay line. You can use
        those for subtle flanging, wide chorus or wild modulations, depending also on how you set the delay lines. The factory
        presets, there are 80 now, should give you some examples.</P>

        <P><A name="modulations" id="modulations"></A><B>About Modulations.</B></P>

        <P>Understanding Sinnah&#39;s modulations is paramount for enhanced sound design.</P>

        <P>As many as ten modulation sources are featured in the 1.1 release. Some of them are simple and dedicated to one or two
        targets, others have more options.</P>

        <P><B># 1)</B> The ADSR envelope always modulates the amplitude of the sound as you may expect. Moreover it can be routed to
        change the &quot;wave&quot; number and to modulate the &quot;harmonics&quot; parameter amount. Note that if the
        &quot;link&quot; switch below &quot;noise&quot; is on, the parameter &quot;noise&quot; will also be modulated. Note also
        that when the envelope is routed to &quot;harmonics&quot; you have the maximum effect when the &quot;full&quot; switch is
        on and the &quot;harmonics&quot; knob is turned hard right.</P>

        <P><B># 2)</B> The delay matrix has three dedicated LFOs, one for each delay line. Each of those features a single smoothed random
        waveshape, similar to the so-called &quot;sample &amp; hold&quot;, and modulates the delay time (or tuning, depending on the
        &quot;memory&quot; switch). The depth of modulation is controlled by the &quot;range&quot; knob, whose value is displayed
        in milliseconds. The rate of the LFO is controlled by the &quot;speed&quot; knob, which displays its value in hertz.</P>

        <P><B># 3)</B> The delay matrix feedback amount is modulated by its own AR envelope, which allows to fade in and fade out the
        amount of feedback. Note that the AR ranges of this envelope are greater than those in the amplitude ADSR.</P>

        <P><B># 4)</B> The LFO in the &quot;tweaks&quot; zone is the most versatile of the modulation sources. The five controls for the
        LFO are:</P>P-1) &quot;type&quot;: a menu to select the type of waveshape to be used. There are nine to chose from:
        &quot;Λ&quot; for a triangular waveshape, &quot;/&quot; for a ramp up waveshape, &quot;Π&quot; for a square waveshape,
        &quot;\&quot; for a ramp down waveshape, &quot;~&quot; for a sine waveshape, &quot;noise1&quot; for filtered noise source,
        &quot;S+H1&quot; for standard randomized &quot;sample &amp; hold&quot; source, &quot;noise2&quot; for more filtered noise
        source, &quot;S+H2&quot; for smoothed randomized &quot;sample &amp; hold&quot; source.<BR><BR>
        P-2) &quot;speed&quot; : a box slider to adjust the LFO rate in hertz for the periodic waveshapes and fine tunes the
        relative filter for the &quot;noise1&quot; and &quot;noise2&quot; waveshapes.<BR><BR>
        P-3) &quot;delay&quot; : a box slider to adjust the delay applied to the LFO depth, in seconds. The depth is faded in from
        zero to the selected depth.<BR><BR>
        P-4) &quot;depth&quot; : a box slider to adjust the amount of modulation. Note that the display can change according to the
        selected LFO target. When the value range is 0.0 .. 1.0 it means that at 1.0 the target is modulated from zero to the value
        set in target control. For instance if the target is &quot;harmonics&quot; and its knob is in the middle position, with LFO
        depth at 1.0 the &quot;harmonics&quot; will be modulated from zero to that middle value. When the value of the
        &quot;depth&quot; display is negative (where available) the phase of the LFO waveshape will be inverted, that allows some
        subtle variations.<BR><BR>
        P-5) &quot;target&quot; : a menu to select the destination of the LFO modulation. Currently in Sinnah 1.1 there are eight
        LFO targets, this will be expanded in the future versions.<BR>

        <P><B># 5)</B> Sinnah 1.1 has five MIDI controls. These are the velocity sensitivity for the ADSR envelope, the Pitchbend range,
        the ModWheel (CC 1) routing, the Aftertouch routing and the keytracking (note number to level). <BR>ModWheel (MW) always
        modulates the target value from zero to the value set by the relative knob.<BR> Aftertouch (AT) modulates the target value in a
        similar way but with a reduced range appropriate for each selected target. <BR>The keytracking (keytrk) scales the value of the
        target relatively to the note played. There are two keytracking controls: one to set the centre note (the one that will not
        be affected). The other one adjusts the slope of the curve that maps the level per key to the scaling of the
        target.</P>

        <HR>

        <P><A name="features" id="features"></A><B>Planned features</B></P>

        <P>For this freeware 1.1 edition an LFO was added, and adjustable pitchbend range, ModWheel, Aftertouch, keytracking on
        Harmonics and Volume, sustain pedal as well.</P>

        <P>I will try to upgrade Sinnah following the requests submitted by users. So it means that we start with a features list
        and you can vote for your favourites, and even suggest features not listed yet.</P>

        <P>The features with a rate of five or above will be implemented in the Sinnah freeware, when we&#39;ll reach what I think
        it can be a critical threshold, Sinnah will split in Sinnah freeware and Sinnah Pro.</P>

        <P>Sinnah freeware will keep the features up to the &quot;critical threshold&quot; and will stay free.<BR>
        All next new features would be implemented in Sinnah Pro which will be payware.</P>

        <P>To vote for a features you can simply write on our forum or send an e-mail to nusofting@liqihsynth.com.</P>

        <P>This is the first NUSofting plugin to use our brand new framework for development, thus we&#39;ll be very happy to read
